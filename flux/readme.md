## Tested Part

- Pine Sap
- Isopropyl Alcohol

## Untested

this both can reduce smoke
- Glycerin 
- Citric Acid (corrosive)

- Vaseline ( to make it behave like goo )
- White Spirit


## Notes

i do had test Pine Sap and IPA, but i think i mess up the ratio ( too concentrated on the Pine Sap )

oh, and my cheap-ass solder wick became easier to use.
